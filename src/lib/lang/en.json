The design was pre-existing, and my role was to code the interface. Our project earned third best place in the event.",
				"keyFeatures": "Users can choose nicknames and start playing the quiz. The quiz is based on rooms, where you can create a room that allows many users to join and play together. The quiz lasts 30 seconds, and once time is up, your score is displayed. After other players finish the game, a scoreboard shows the rankings of the best players and their scores. Since this was a 24-hour challenge, many features were implemented in a rushed manner, and some edge cases were not handled properly."

			"project12": {
				"projectTitle": "No Push Main",
				"description": "A simple script I designed to enforce a global (system-wide, project-agnostic) pre-push hook that prevents developers from pushing changes directly to the main branch of a Git repository. The script ensures that all changes are pushed to a separate branch, requiring a review before being merged into the main branch. This approach helps maintain the integrity of the main branch and reduces the risk of accidental code changes or conflicts. The hook can be set up globally for all Git projects, unlike tools like Husky, which require configuration for each individual project. The README on the GitHub repository provides detailed instructions on how to install and remove the hook from your system.",
