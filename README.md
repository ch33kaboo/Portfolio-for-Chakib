# Portfolio for Chakib

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site is hosted on **Netlify** and can be accessed at [**chakib.tech**](https://chakib.tech).

The project is built using **SvelteKit**, styled with **TailwindCSS**, and uses **daisyUI** as a component library.

Internationalization is handled using **sveltekit-i18n** (English, French, and German). This library also supports SSR, so this internationalization is server side rendered.
