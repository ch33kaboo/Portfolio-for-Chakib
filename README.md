# Portfolio for Chakib

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, [**chakib.tech**](https://chakib.tech).

### Used Technologies

The project is built using **SvelteKit**, styled with **TailwindCSS**, and uses **daisyUI** as a component library. Hosted on **Netlify** and can be accessed at [**chakib.tech**](https://chakib.tech).

Internationalization is handled using **sveltekit-i18n** (English, French, and German). This library also supports SSR, so this internationalization is server side rendered.

### CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses a CI/CD pipeline. Each time a commit is pushed to the `production` branch in this repo, Netlify automatically builds and deploys the latest version of the site.
